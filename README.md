#  My Framework

Backbone to easily write simple apps using the powerfull Flutter UI to design and fast and flexible SQFLite to store data.
This is the juice I got sqeezing Models and Apis during development of different apps.
I don't have too much time to make a good documentation of the Library yet, but for sure it is a work in progress and it will be refined.
Obviously not all the code or the ideas in this framework are mine.

It works on a [View - ViewModel - Service] frame, as for UI dart code, Business logic and Storage/APIs interfaces.
The frame lays [Models] that contains common objects definitions.
